# Assembly Racing Game
This code is a game written in x86 assembly language. It is a side-scrolling car game where the player controls a car and tries to avoid obstacles on the road.

 ## Prerequisites
 
To run this game, you will need a computer with an x86 processor and a compatible assembler. 
The code is written in assembly language, so you need to have an understanding of assembly programming to modify or enhance the game.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code file in an x86 assembly language editor or assembler.
3. Assemble and link the code to generate an executable file.
4. Run the executable file to start the game.

## Game Controls

* Use the arrow keys to control the car: Up arrow to accelerate, Down arrow to decelerate, Left arrow to move left, and Right arrow to move right.
